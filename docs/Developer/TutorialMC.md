**Tutorial to Build a Button Script Program:**

This tutorial lets you write code that can send a series of hardcoded button commands to Switch to control a game.
Function-wise it's like a programmable smart Switch controller.
Note it is a non-feedback program because no video or audio detection is used.

- Build the source code of our [codebase](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Arduino-Source/tree/main/SerialPrograms). See the [Git guide](Git.md) for how to download and prepare for source code version control. If successful, you can run the built program **SerialPrograms(.exe)** to run existing automation programs. 

- To write a new program, the easiest way is to study the existing non-feedback program
[**PokemonLA_BraviaryHeightGlitch**](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Arduino-Source/blob/main/SerialPrograms/Source/PokemonLA/Programs/General/PokemonLA_BraviaryHeightGlitch.h).
The program applys an exploit while the player character rides on Braviary so that the player can gain unlimited height in the overworld.
See its [Wiki page](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/PokemonLA/BraviaryHeightGlitch.md) on how to use the program.

	- A more complex program example is [**PokemonLA_ApplyGrits**](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Arduino-Source/blob/main/SerialPrograms/Source/PokemonLA/Programs/General/PokemonLA_ApplyGrits.h) ([Wiki](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/PokemonLA/ApplyGrits.md)).

- Copy the code in **PokemonLA_BraviaryHeightGlitch** to create a new program listed in SerialPrograms/Source/PokemonLA/Programs/ and compile it. If successful, you can run **SerialPrograms** and notice a new program appears under the *LA* panel.

- Change the code in function `BraviaryHeightGlitch::program()` to add your own code by trying some `pbf_xxx()` function calls. Those functions send button commands to Switch. They are defined in [NintendoSwitch_Commands_PushButtons.h](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Arduino-Source/blob/main/SerialPrograms/Source/NintendoSwitch/Commands/NintendoSwitch_Commands_PushButtons.h) to control the game. Example button commands are `pbf_press_button()` and `pbf_press_dpad()`. You can read the comments of those functions to understand how to use them.

- Compile the program and test it on your Switch.

- Congratulations! You now have a working Switch controller button script program! You can write button sequence of arbitrary complexity to control your Switch game!

- If you find an interesting use case of your script in one of the Pok√©mon games, you are welcome to submit this script to our team to be used by our users. See the [Git guide](Git.md) for how to submit code.

	- After your new program is accepted to our codebase, there is also a need to write a wiki for the program so that users know how to use it! Our program wiki is actually a Github repo [**ComputerControl**](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl). Each wiki page is written as a .md file in the repo. It should be fairly easy to learn the .md writing format. You can use the similiar Github development cycle in the [Git guide](Git.md) to submit your new wiki page.
