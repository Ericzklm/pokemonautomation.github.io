If you are not familiar with several items in the requirement list below, you are still welcome to try developing.
If you encounter something you don't know, you will be fine as long as you can learn them during development.
There are many online resources that help you learn new things in programming and we are here to help.

Feel free to ask us any questions regarding program development in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/cQ4gWxN).

**Development knowledge list:**

- Know how to use a build tool (e.g. CMake, Visual Studio, VS Code, Qt Creator) to build and run a C++ program.
