# Tenacity Candy Farmer

## Program Description

Farm experience, Exp Candy XL and various evolution items from Ingo's Path of Tenacity battles.

This program will repeatedly battle Pearl Clan in Path of Tenacity with a strong Arceus.

This program only works on game version 1.1 and later, after Path of Tenacity is made available in Daybreak DLC.

Compared with [Nugget Farmer (Highlands)](NuggetFarmerHighlands.md), this program earns money slightly faster (by selling the Exp Candy XL and evolution items) and earns exp (gained both from battles and Exp Candies) much faster.

4. You have beaten Pearl Clan in Path of Tenacity at least four times to fully upgrade their team.
5. Have a stats fully upgraded, max level, Modest nature Arceus with Legend Plate applied.
6. Set the Arceus' moves in the following order as Judgement, Energy Ball, Flash Cannon, and any other move. (You can choose Flamethrower as the last move to grind a research task. See below.) No need for Arceus to master those moves.

The program will repeatedly talk to Ingo. It will choose Pearl Clan as the opponent in Path of Tenacity. The program will defeat opponents using the first three moves in a determined order. Each Path of Tenacity win gives you some experience to your party, 3 Exp Candy XL, and a random evolution item. Each battle takes about four minutes.

Evolution items from the battles include Leaf Stones, Fire Stones, Ice Stones, Dawn Stones, Razor Claws, Razor Fangs, Black Augurites, Peat Blocks and possibly more. Note it has a decent chance to give Peat Blocks. So it's also an easy way to get Peat Blocks to evolve Ursaring.

The program will keep battling if Arceus runs out of PP on one move or faints in battle. After Arceus faints, it has the same default AI behavior as in the program [Ingo Battle Grinder](IngoBattleGrinder.md).

**Warning:**

There is a small chance the Arceus may lose to Pearl Clan. To ensure victory, you can put a strong Pokémon with a strong first move as the second Pokémon to send to battle.

## Options

### Fourth Move on

Let the program use Arceus' fourth move on one of the opponenent's Pokémon to grind their research tasks:
- Set the fourth move to be Flamethrower to grind Mamoswine's research task.
- Set the fourth move to be Rock Smash to grind Avalugg's research task.

Note, there is a small chance for the Goodra before the Mamoswine to survive one Judgement.
In this case, ignorant of Goodra's survival, the program may use the fourth move on Goodra.
It will still very likely to win the battle. So no need to worry about it.
