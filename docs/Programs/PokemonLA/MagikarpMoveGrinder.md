# Magikarp Move Grinder

## Program Description

Grind those Pokédex research tasks about status moves and move styles by battling poor Magikarp.

This program will use moves from your Pokémon repeatedly when battling a Magikarp. It will switch to next Pokémon when the current move has no PP left.

Wild Magikarp only knows Splash with 40 PP. Splash does no damage. So it is safe to grind status moves by battling wild Magikarp.
You need to specify how many Pokémon you would like to grind with by adding that many rows in Pokémon Action Table option. The program will grind the first move of each Pokémon attended. You can choose which style to use on each move to grind style usages. When one move has no PP, the program will switch to the next Pokémon in the party list after it finds the move selection menu is not closed in time. The program can also detect when you Pokémon faints and send the next Pokémon out to battle.

**Example usages:**

Bring a team of six eeveelutions. Set Baby-Doll Eyes as their first moves. Go to the river in Obsidian Fieldlands where several Magikarp lives. Bring enough Max Ethers. Use the program to grind agile style Baby-Doll Eyes to finish the research tasks of using Baby-Doll Eyes and using agile style moves.

You can use Max Ethers to recover PPs after the program finishes and find another Magikarp in the river to continue grinding. You can earn money fast using our program, [Tenacity Candy Farmer](TenacityCandyFarmer.md) and buy ingredients to craft many Max Ethers.

We also add an option to grind move Mimic, which is the research task of Mime Jr., Mr. Mime, Bonsly and Sudowoodo. See below.

## Options


### Pokémon Action Table
A table where each row sets the move style for each Pokémon. The program grinds the first move of each Pokémon until there is no PP and switches to the next Pokémon.
The order of the table rows is the order your Pokémon in the Party, where the first row corresponds to your party lead.

Note: start the battle with wrong Pokémon order will result in wrong moves being ground.


### Special Case, Mimic
Grind Mimic move usages by switching between first two Pokémon.

Set the first move as Mimic on the first two Pokémon (can be Mime Jr., Mr. Mime, Bonsly or Sudowoodo).
After switching, the retreated Pokémon will forget the move learned by Mimic, allowing efficient Mimic grinding.
Choosing this will ignore the content in Pokémon Action Table.
