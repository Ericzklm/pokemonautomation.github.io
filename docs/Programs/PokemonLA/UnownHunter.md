## Program Description

These are the Pokémon this program can shiny hunt:

- Unown
- Psyduck
- Carnivine
- Kricketot
- Kricketune

The program will loop through going from the village to Solaceon Ruins until a shiny is found. There is a chance of a Bronzor/Brozong MMO in the ruins rather than Unowns, the program will keep running regardless. Also, to avoid getting into a battle with Bronzong, the program retuns to the tunnel so it can fly back to the camp.

**Notes:**

- If you using Discord notifications please bear in mind sometimes the screenshot won't show the shiny.
- Upon finding a shiny, the program will go back to home screen. Go back to game and save before attempting to catch the shiny, as Unowns can potentially run away after one miss catch. 


## Options

### Shiny Detected Actions

There are two of these options - one for enroute, and one for the destination. Thus you can customize the behavior - such as ignoring shinies while enroute.

**Shiny Detected Action:**

- Ignore the shiny. Do not stop the program.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot. Then go Home.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot + video. Then go Home.

**Screenshot Delay:**

If the above is set to stop on a shiny, the program will align the camera and wait X time to potentially allow the shiny to come into view of the camera.
This has no functional affect on the program. Don't set this value too large as some Pokémon will run away from you.
