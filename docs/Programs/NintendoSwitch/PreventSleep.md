# Prevent Sleep

## Program Description

Prevent your Switch from sleeping by pressing B every 15 seconds.

The purpose of this program is to keep your Switch awake during remote access. The device cannot wake up the Switch if it goes to sleep. So if it sleeps, you lose the Switch until somebody can manually wake it back up. This is obviously a bad thing if you are away on vacation and are trying to manage your unattended shiny hunts remotely.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the Switch Home.
2. Click "Start Program".

The program will press B every 15 seconds.

> This doesn't *require* that you be in the Switch Home menu, but it does require you to be in a place where the controller's button presses are being accepted. If you are inside a single-player game that disables all but the primary controller, these B presses will be ignored if your device is not the primary controller.
> 
> **Note:** There is an option in the Switch settings to prevent the Switch from sleeping from being idle. That is probably the preferred method if you are running remotely and do not want to risk the Switch sleeping.
