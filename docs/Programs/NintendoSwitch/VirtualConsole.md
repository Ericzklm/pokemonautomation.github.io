# Virtual Console

**Related Programs:**

- **Computer Control:** [Virtual Console](VirtualConsole.md) (this program)
- **Computer Control:** [Switch Viewer](SwitchViewer.md)


## Program Description

This is the default program that runs when you run the SerialPrograms binary. It consists of only the serial connection and a camera drop-down to view your Switch.

Since all programs in the left panel act as virtual consoles, the actual Virtual Console program can be considered the "null program". It has no program associated with it and only presents the basic play-on-your-computer components.

The Virtual Console is primarily used for two purposes. But really any program can do this:

1. Play your Switch on your computer and/or verify that all the connectivity is working.
2. View logging information from a native program. (thus superceding the old DeviceLogger)

## Instructions

None since the Virtual Console isn't a program. But here are the basic setup instructions that apply to both the Virtual Console and all other programs.

1. Select the appropriate Serial Port and Camera for your Switch.
   > If you don't know which are the correct ones, try all of them.

2. Click on the "Output Window" to see logging.
   > If the program that is flashed to the device is a [microcontroller program](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/tree/master/Wiki/Programs) that has logging, you will see it here.

3. Click on the video to activate the keyboard controls and play on your computer.
   > This requires that the program on the device is PABotBase.
   > PABotBase is the only program that will accept keyboard commands.

If you don't know the keyboard/button mappings, you can view that by clicking on the "Keyboard Layout" button in the bottom-left section of the program.
