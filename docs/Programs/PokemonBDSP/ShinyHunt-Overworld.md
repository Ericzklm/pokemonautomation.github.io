### Instructions

1. Stand in a spot where you can move left/right or up/down forever and not wander off.
2. Make sure you are safe from getting attacked by trainers.
3. Start the program in game. Make sure the device is the connected controller.


## Options


### Go Home when Done:

After finding a shiny, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.


### Game Language:

If set to a language, the program will attempt to read the name of each Pokémon you encounter and log it.

If you are playing in an Asian language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese), set your video resolution to 1080p or higher. These languages are difficult to accurately read with text recognition at low resolutions.


### Trigger Method:

Set how to trigger a wild Pokémon encounter.

#### Maneuver:

How to move around overworld to trigger an encounter.
Pick the one that's most appropriate for your location:

- Move left/right. (no bias)
- Move left/right. (bias left)
- Move left/right. (bias right)
- Move up/down. (no bias)
- Move up/down. (bias up)
- Move up/down. (bias down)
- Use Sweet Scent.

The "bias" will make it travel in that direction a little bit more. So if you're standing against a wall that's unbounded on the other side, you'll want to bias in the direction of the wall to avoid drifting away from it. Lead your party with a Pokémon of the ability like Illuminate to increase the encounter rate.

Sweet Scent method does not move the player character. It will select one of your Pokémon in the party and use Sweet Scent to start the encounter. Sweet Scent method has the benefit of adding no friendship to your party, while the other trigger methods increase friendship to your party because of constant walking. It can also be used in the Great Marsh without the limitation on the number of steps. The encounter rate of Sweet Scent is slightly below or if not about the same as the best encounter rate achieved by the other walking methods.

To use Sweet Scent:

1. The menu cursor should be over the Pokémon option.
2. There must be a Pokémon in your party knowing the move Sweet Scent.
3. The move must be callable as the second menu item when you select the Pokémon in the Pokémon view, directly after "Check summary". In other words, to avoid any trouble, don't let the Sweet Scent Pokémon know other overworld-usable moves like Dig.
4. The Sweet Scent Pokémon can be put in any location of the party. But for best performance place it as the party lead.


#### Move Duration:

Travel for this long before changing directions. This option is ignored if **Maneuver** is set as Sweet Scent.

#### Sweet Scent Pokémon Location:

When Sweet Scent is selected in **Maneuver**, the location of the Pokémon in the party to use Sweet Scent.


### Use Sound Detection:

Whether to use sound detection to improve shiny detection robustness. Make sure you have proper audio input set.


### Stop On:

Choose when to stop the program. You can set Shiny, NonShiny, Anything or Nothing.


### Overrides:

Set more complex program action that overrides the default behavior.


### Video Capture:

Whether to take a video of the encounter if it is a shiny.


### Reset Game in Case of Error:

When the program encounters an error, whether to reset the game to fix it.



## Advanced Settings:
These are advanced settings. You shouldn't need to touch these unless something isn't working and you're trying to debug it yourself.


### Exit Battle Timeout:

After running, wait this long to return to the overworld. The program will resume before this time if it detects that that the battle has ended.
