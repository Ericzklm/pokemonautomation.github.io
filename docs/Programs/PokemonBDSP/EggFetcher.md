# Egg Fetcher

## Program Description

Fetch eggs into your boxes without hatching them.

This program is used with [EggHatcher](EggHatcher.md) to fetch and hatch eggs. Thus you first fetch a bunch of eggs with EggFetcher, then you hatch them with EggHatcher.

3. The parents are already deposited at the daycare center.

## Options

### Go Home when Done:

After the program finishes, go to the Switch Home to idle.

### Bike Shortcut:

This is the Dpad button that is used to quickly trigger the bike.

### Fetch Attempts:

Make this many attempts to fetch an egg. The only reason to set this option is to avoid over-fetching of eggs and clogging up all your boxes.

### Travel Time per Fetch:

Spin on your bike for this long before attempting to fetch another egg.
