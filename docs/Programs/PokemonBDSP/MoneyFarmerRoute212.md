## Options


### VS Seeker Shortcut:

This is the Dpad button that is used to quickly trigger the VS Seeker.

### Start Location:

The start location of your character. It is either in front of the Hearthome City Pokémon Center or in the row above the old couple.

### Move 1/2/3/4 PP:

This the amount of PP for each of your lead Pokémon's moves.
If you don't wish to use a move, set the PP to zero. If you do wish to use a move, it must be able to OHKO the lady's Roselia.

When the program runs out of PP for a move, it moves to the next move. Once there is no PP left for all available moves, it flies back to Hearthome City to heal and return.
