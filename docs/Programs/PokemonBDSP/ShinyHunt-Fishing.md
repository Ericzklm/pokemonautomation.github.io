## Options


### Go Home when Done:

After finding a shiny, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.


### Game Language:

If set to a language, the program will attempt to read the name of each Pokémon you encounter and log it.

If you are playing in an Asian language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese), set your video resolution to 1080p or higher. These languages are difficult to accurately read with text recognition at low resolutions.


### Fishing Shortcut:

This is the Dpad button that is used to quickly trigger the fishing rod.

### Use Sound Detection:

Whether to use sound detection to improve shiny detection robustness. Make sure you have proper audio input set.

### Stop On:

Choose when to stop the program. You can set Shiny, NonShiny, Anything or Nothing.

### Overrides:

Set more complex program action that overrides the default behavior.

### Video Capture:

Whether to take a video of the encounter if it is a shiny.

## Advanced Settings:
These are advanced settings. You shouldn't need to touch these unless something isn't working and you're trying to debug it yourself.


### Exit Battle Timeout:

After running, wait this long to return to the overworld. The program will resume before this time if it detects that that the battle has ended.
