This program requires that the menu overlap glitch be already active. *How* you choose activate is the glitch is up to you (and dependent on the game version).

You can use [this program](ActivateMenuGlitch-Poketch.md) to help you activate the menu glitch on 1.1.2.

(Note there is a slightly [faster method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNYA9PzCAw) to clone items.
However, this approach is harder to automate because the sequence breaks when your bag is full.)
