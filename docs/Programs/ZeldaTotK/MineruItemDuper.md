This program is for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The program is still within the Pok√©mon Automation program. It does not require video feedback.

**Version 1.1 or 1.1.1 of the game is required.** The glitch this program uses does not work in version 1.0 or versions 1.1.2 and above.

## Program Description
