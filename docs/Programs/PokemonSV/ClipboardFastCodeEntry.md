## Program Description

This is an optimized version of the original [Fast Code Entry](../PokemonSwSh/FastCodeEntry.md).

This program does not have a code entry box. Instead, it monitors your clipboard and immediately begins entering it the moment you copy a valid code.

Therefore, this program is faster than the original FCE for entering raids as it automates away the CTRL-V and start program clicks. Furthermore, this program will allow you to FCE into auto-hosted raids without moving the mouse as you only need to double-click and CTRL-C.

As with all FCE programs, the usual disclaimer applies:

***By using this program, you agree that you are an asshole. Furthermore, you will be required to embrace your asshole status by flaunting it in front of all the people you've blocked out of raids.***
