# Tera Battle Options

These are settings that are used by all programs that do Tera battles.

Programs that use these include:

- [Auto-Host](AutoHost.md)
- [Tera Self Farmer](TeraSelfFarmer.md)
- [Tera Multi-Farmer](TeraMultiFarmer.md)


## Options


### Battle AI:

All programs that need to battle out a Tera raid use the same AI module which use these settings.

**Try to Terastillize:** Try to terastillize if available. Adds 4 seconds per try but can greatly increase win rate.

**Move Table:** Pre-program your Pok√©mon to use this sequence of moves. When the end of the table is reached, it will repeat the last entry of the table until the battle is won or lost.
