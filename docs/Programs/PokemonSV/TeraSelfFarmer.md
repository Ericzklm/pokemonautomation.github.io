# Tera Self Farmer

## Program Description

This program will date-spam for tera raids and battle them. This program is useful for farming items and random dex-filling. While it is most effective on easy raids (1-4 stars), it can also win 5-star raids if you have a suitable lead Pokémon.

This program can also be used to hunt for shiny raids or raids with high item rewards for the purpose of re-hosting them.

1. Screen size: Must be 100% within the Switch settings
2. [Switch 2: The profile you are using must be the 1st (left-most) profile.](../NintendoSwitch/Switch2Notes.md#resetting-a-game-moves-the-cursor-to-the-1st-user-profile)

### Instructions

1. You have done a raid at least once to clear in-game raid guide.
2. You must be facing an active Tera raid crystal facing south, or standing directly on a crystal spawn spot.*
3. Your location should be safe from getting attacked by wild Pokémon.
4. Your lead Pokémon should be able to reliably beat raids by spamming its first move. Pick a move that is strong and has few types resistant to it.
5. Start the program in game.

\*After completing a raid, your character will rotate to face south. Thus if you aren't already facing south, the crystal spawns may no longer be in front of you.



## Options

### Game Language:

The language of your game. This is needed to read the ball names to select the correct ball.


### Opponent Filter:

**Min/Max Stars:** Skip all raids that don't have a star count in this range.

By default it skips 5+ star raids since they usually have low win rates. But if you have a strong lead Pokémon, you can allow 5-star raids which may have herb rewards.


### Tera Battle Options

See [Tera Battle Options](TeraBattleOptions.md).


### Catch on Win:

Check this box to catch the Pokémon when you win. Catching is required to check for shininess.

**Ball Select:** Catch the Pokémon using this ball.

**Fix Clock on Catch:** Fix the time when catching so the caught date will be correct.


### Stop Conditions:

**Max Catches:** Stop the program after catching this many Pokémon. Use this to avoid filling up all your boxes. If you are not catching, this parameter is ignored.

**Stop on Shiny:** Stop the program if the Pokémon you caught is shiny. Resetting the game will return you to the front of this (shiny) raid so it can be hosted again.

**Stop on Rare Items:** Stop the program if the item rewards contain at least this many rare (sparkly) items. Like for shinies, you can reset to re-host this raid. Set to zero to disable this and never stop for item rewards.
