### Instructions

1. Make sure you have all 3 Gold Canari Plushies. Otherwise you will lose money over time!
2. Stand facing the restaurant receptionist.
3. Start the program in the game.

This program has 2 modes: With and without a battle AI.

**With Battle AI (new to v0.59.5):**

In this mode, the program will choose the move with the best type effectiveness against the opponents. In the event of a tie, they will chosen in this priority order:

- Top
- Left
- Right
- Bottom


**Without Battle AI:**

In this mode, the program will spam 3 moves in the following priority:

- Top
- Left
- Bottom

It will never use the Right move slot as that is the A button which interferes with parts of the program.


In both modes, if your Pokémon faints, it will automatically timeout and switch to the next Pokémon in your party. Keep that in mind if you expect your lead to faint. The move priority is the same for all members of your party.


### Tips

With battle AI enabled, have 4 strong moves of different types that maximize type coverage. The order does not matter.

Restaurant Le Yeah: To avoid being stalled by Talonflame/Altaria, choose Pokemon with these attributes:
- Talonflame's Flame Wheel should not be the highest damaging option against your Pokemon. Talonflame's moves are Hurricane, Flame Wheel, U-Turn, and Steel Wing
- The move in the top slot should be able to one-hit KO Talonflame. Talonflame is level 45 so the bar is fairly low.

Sushi High Roller: The player is not immune to damage here so you can lose if the player takes too much damage from stray attacks. Choose Pokemon that have good AOE moves and ones that cant faint since the opponents target you if your Pokemon faint.
