## Settings

1. As with all LGPE programs, Right Joycon is required. This program will not run otherwise.
2. System time: Un-synced
3. Text speed: Fast
4. If you have CFW and sys-botbase running, you must disable ld-mitm or the game will crash.

## Instructions

1. Stand facing the location of any item that respawns daily.

    - If in an area with wild encounters, use a Repel.

2. Start the program in-game.

ex. In Cerulean Cave, there is a spot near Mewtwo (pictured above) with a 100% chance to spawn a fossil daily. This program will work to farm the fossils. However, Cerulean Cave also has a floor with Poke Balls, Berries, and fossils that respawn after 256 steps. This program will not work on those.
