# Legendary Reset

## Program Description

Shiny hunt Legendary Pokemon by resetting the game.

[Demo Video (Youtube)](https://youtu.be/OfIMRUpcehU?si=Ce-jKAddN91fQ4m5)

## Settings

1. As with all LGPE programs, Right Joycon (ESP32 setup) is required. This program will not run otherwise.
2. Text speed: Fast
3. Movie Skipping: On
4. Battle Effects: Off
5. Background Music/Sound Effects/Pokemon Cries: Don't mute. Default value is 5.

## Setup

1. Your lead must not be shiny.
2. Your lead must be able to reliably defeat the target in 5 minutes by spamming their first move. Lead must not faint.
3. If targeting Snorlax, you must have cleared Mr. Fuji's tutorial text. (So target the second Snorlax you fight, not the first one.)

## Instructions

1. Stand in front of the target Pokemon.
2. Save the game.
3. Start the program in-game.

The program will reset until it detects a shiny. It will then defeat the shiny using your lead's first move. This is because the 5 minute battle timer does not pause, even when the Switch is on the Home Menu. Once the shiny is defeated, it will not run away during the catching sequence. (*This does not apply to Snorlax or Electrode. They can still flee.)

For Snorlax and Electrode, this program works on the static encounters.

## Options

### Target:

The Pokemon you are hunting.

### Go Home when Done:

Go to the Switch Home to idle when finished.
