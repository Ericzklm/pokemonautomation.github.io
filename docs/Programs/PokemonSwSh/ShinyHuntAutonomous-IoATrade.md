## Program Description

This is the autonomous version of [ShinyHuntUnattended-IoATrade](ShinyHuntUnattended-IoATrade.md).

This program will automatically hunt for a shiny Regina trade and stop on a shiny. It requires video feedback and has these advantages over the unattended version of this program:

- No calibration is needed. This program will detect a shiny from its shiny icon.
- When a shiny is found, this program will save a video of the encounter.
- Autonomous programs are faster than their unattended counterparts since they use feedback instead of timed waits.
- This program will keep track of encounter statistics.
- This program will automatically recover from errors by resetting the game.

### Go Home when Done:

After finding a shiny, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.

### Rollover Prevention:

This is useful if your game is holding a den and you do not want an unintentional date-skip to destroy it.

Prevent the den from rolling over by periodically touching the date at this interval. Set this value to zero to disable the feature.


## Advanced Settings:

These are advanced settings. You shouldn't need to touch these unless something isn't working and you're trying to debug it yourself.

### Mash to Trade Delay:

This is how long from when you start the trade to when the trade ends. You shouldn't need to change this.
