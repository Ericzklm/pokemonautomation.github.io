## Options

### Number of Highlights:

The number of Daily Highlights you want the program to manipulate and buy. 
Keep in mind not all manipulations are successful. 
The program will keep running even if you have not enough Watts left.
If this option is set to zero the program will continue running until it is stopped manually.


### Calibrate the Number of NPCs this Many Day Skips:

How often the number of NPCs should be calibrated.
The program needs to know how many NPCs are in the area but it takes time to calibrate.
If you have a low success rate decrease this value.


### Desired Highlights:

The selection of items you want the program to get.
