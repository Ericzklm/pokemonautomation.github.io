### Default Program Settings

The program will travel back-and-forth between the two dens closest to the Bridge Field daycare center. Each time, it will drop a wishing piece and enter the den to let you view it.

This program goes back-and-forth between the following two dens:

- **Den 5/46 (Shedinja):** By the trees near the Obstagoon.
- **Den 4/92 (Gmax Orbeetle):** To the right of the Digging Duo.


## Options:

This program uses [**Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)**](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/FrameworkSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.

Most of the options here are self-explanatory.
