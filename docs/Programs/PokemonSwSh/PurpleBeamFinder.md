### Setup of Settings

**Switch Settings:**

1. Screen size: Must be 100% within the Switch settings

**Program Settings:**

1. Video Resolution: 720p or higher

**Game Settings:**

1. Text Speed: ***SLOW*** (this is different from other programs!)
2. Casual mode: Off

### Instructions

1. Stand in front of an empty den with watts collected.
2. Verify there are no purple beams visible in the background.

   > If there are, it may detect the background beam instead

3. The weather is not snow or snowstorm. Intensive weather can interfere with the detection.
4. Save in the position listed in #1
5. Close the menu (if not already closed).
6. Start the program in game or the [Change Grip/Order Menu](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md) depending on which option you choose.

   > When the program finds a purple beam, it will make a lot of noise to get your attention.


## Options

This program uses [**Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)**](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/FrameworkSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.

Most of the options here are self-explanatory.
