See [Maximizing Switch Stability](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/SwitchStability.md).


## Options

Most of the options here are self-explanatory.
This program does not use the global setting to bypassing the system update window. It has its own setting for that. (See below.)


### Dodge System Update Window:

When enabled, the program will dodge the system update window. Do not set this option if the system update window is not present. Unlike other programs, MassRelease will not be able to tolerate the extra button presses if they land in the box system.
