## Program Description

This is the autonomous version of [ShinyHuntUnattended-Regi](ShinyHuntUnattended-Regi.md).

This program will automatically hunt for a shiny Regi golem and automatically stop on a shiny. It requires video feedback and has these advantages over the unattended version of this program:

- No calibration is needed. This program will detect a shiny from its animation.
- When a shiny is encountered, this program will save a video of the encounter.
- This program will distinguish star shinies from square shinies.
- There is an option to hunt only for squares and run from all stars.
- Autonomous programs are faster than their unattended counterparts since they use feedback instead of timed waits.
- This program will keep track of encounter statistics.
- Light corrections are now on-demand instead of periodic. This program will detect when the floor lights are wrong and will do the correction only when needed.

### Default Program Settings

- No calibration is needed. This program uses the capture card to detect a shiny from its animation.
- When a shiny is encountered, this program will save a video of the encounter.
- Default settings are to stop on any shiny. If you wish to search for a square Regi, check the box in the settings to only stop on square.
- This program will keep track of encounter statistics.
- If the program gets stuck, it will exit and re-enter the building.


## Options

This program uses [**Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)**](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/FrameworkSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.

### Go Home when Done:

After finding a shiny, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.

### Require Square:

The option will make the program run from star shinies and stop only on a square shiny. It will still record videos of all shinies.

### Regi:

This is what you're resetting for. Pick from: `Regirock`, `Regice`, `Registeel`, `Regieleki`, and `Regidrago`.

### Rollover Prevention:

This is useful if your game is holding a den and you do not want an unintentional date-skip to destroy it.

Prevent the den from rolling over by periodically touching the date at this interval. Set this value to zero to disable the feature.


## Advanced Settings:
These are advanced settings. You shouldn't need to touch these unless something isn't working and you're trying to debug it yourself.


### Exit Battle Timeout:

After running, wait this long to return to the overworld. The program will resume before this time if it detects that that the battle has ended.

### Transition Delay:

The time needed to enter and exit the building during a correction.
