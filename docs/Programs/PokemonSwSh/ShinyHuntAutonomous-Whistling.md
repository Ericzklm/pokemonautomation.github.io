# Shiny Hunt (Autonomous) - In-place Whistling

## Program Description

This program will stand in one place and whistle. It will run from all non-shiny encounters and stop on the first shiny it finds.

- No calibration is needed. This program will detect a shiny from its animation.
- When a shiny is encountered, this program will save a video of the encounter.
- This program will keep track of encounter statistics.

This program is indended for any flying Pokémon that respawn or overworld Pokémon that will consistently charge at you. 
For regular overworld Pokémon, use the [overworld bot](ShinyHuntAutonomous-Overworld.md) instead.

### Setup of Settings

**Switch Settings:**

1. Screen size: Must be 100% within the Switch settings
2. [Switch 2: The profile you are using must be the 1st (left-most) profile.](../NintendoSwitch/Switch2Notes.md#resetting-a-game-moves-the-cursor-to-the-1st-user-profile)
3. System Time: Unsynced

**Program Settings:**

1. Video Resolution: 720p or higher

**Game Settings:**

1. Text Speed: Fast
2. Casual mode: Off

### Setup of Party

1. Your lead Pokémon must be able to run away (Faster or holding Smoke Ball).
2. Your lead Pokémon must not be shiny. (This will cause false positive detection)

   > **Recommended for Performance:**
   > - Have the Shiny Charm. This triples the chance to find a shiny.
   > - Your lead Pokémon does not have high happiness.
   > - Your lead Pokémon does not have an ability that activates upon entry to battle.

### Instructions

1. You must be standing in a place where you will constantly be attacked by whistling.
   * You must be zoomed out to maximize the view.

2. Save.
3. Return to overworld (not inside the menu).
4. Start the program in game or the [Change Grip/Order Menu](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md) depending on which option you choose.

### Default Program Settings

- No calibration is needed. This program uses the capture card to detect a shiny from its animation.
- When a shiny is encountered, this program will save a video of the encounter.
- This program will keep track of encounter statistics.
- If the program gets stuck, it will reset the game. Thus putting you where you last saved.


## Options

This program uses [**Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)**](../NintendoSwitch/FrameworkSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.

There is no option to search only for a square shiny. Nearly all shinies are square and only 15/65536 are star. Therefore it is infeasible to hunt for star shiny.

### Go Home when Done:

After finding a shiny, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.

### Game Language:

If set to a language, the program will attempt to read the name of each Pokémon you encounter and log it.

If you are playing in an Asian language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese), set your video resolution to 1080p or higher. These languages are difficult to accurately read with text recognition at low resolutions.

### Time Rollback:

Every this many hours, rollback the time by this many hours. This keeps the time constant to prevent the weather from changing. It also allows you to target time-specific marks. Set this to zero to disable this feature.


## Advanced Settings:

These are advanced settings. You shouldn't need to touch these unless something isn't working and you're trying to debug it yourself.

### Exit Battle Timeout:

After running, wait this long to return to the overworld. The program will resume before this time if it detects that that the battle has ended.
